# ## Section 1: Introduction
#
# Welcome our tutorial on Bayesian Networks (Bayes nets)! We're hoping by the time that you have finished the tutorial you will get a sense for the following:
#   * What they are and what classes of problems they can be used to solve
#   * How to implement several common useful operations with a Bayes net
#   * Limitations that the approaches involving Bayes Nets may have
#
# We begin our notebook with some preliminaries (and a fun motivating example) and then move on to describing some preliminary code structures that we'll use throughout the reset of the tutorial.  We then provide some relevant excerpts from our implementation, centered around explaining functionality that we're going to use to solve the problems that our motivating example poses. We then display the potential of a Bayes net against our motiving example. Finally, we point out some limitations of using a Bayes net (primarily the scalability of the approach) to solve our motivating example and discuss (and potentially show) possible ways to address these limitations.

# ### Section 1.1: What exactly is a Bayes Net and what is it good for?
#
# At a high level, a Bayes net is a graphical model that we can use to represent the relationship between different random variables.
#
# TODO(nathan): link this section with the math that follows

# + [markdown] id="UtNOPIcNveIM"
# In this section we further explain how the underlying math is going to work.
# Suppose the space of all state is $X$, observations are $O$, results are $Y$, and hidden states are $X^H$.
#
# We are trying to compute the joint pmf over the entire space: $P(X)$.
#
# **Step 1**: apply chain rule to the joint distribution of $X$.
#
# $$ P(X) = P(Y, O, X^H) = \prod\limits_{\text{$x$ in $X$}}P(x \,| \, \text{parents of $x$} )$$
#
# Thatâ€™s not phenomenally useful yet because this requires a probability mass function for each of the states - hidden and not.
#
# **Step 2**: Apple value elimination by marginalization: the idea is to marginalize the hidden state pmfs out - we only really need to calculate the pmf over the variables we are interested in - observations and results.
#
# $$ P(Y, O) =  \big(\prod\limits_{Y_i}^{m} P(Y_i) \big) \sum\limits_{X_1^H} \big( \prod P(\text{has $X_1^H, Y_i, O_i$ but not $X_js$}) \big)  \sum\limits_{X_2^H} \big( \prod P(\text{has $X_2^H, X_1^H, Y_i, O_i$ but not $X_js$}) \big) \sum \big(...\big)$$
#
# **Step 3**: Condition on observations at current step $O^i = \{o^i_1, o^i_2, ...\}$:
#
# $$ P(Y|O) = \frac{P(Y, O)}{P(O)} = \eta \sum\limits_{X_H}P(Y, X^H, O^i) $$
#
# (we don't actually need to compute $P(O)$ since we will be computing belief assignment over all results, so $P(O)$ becomes a normalization factor. )
#
# **Step 4**: find maximal assignments. Now, if what we need is to get the most likely event, computing maximums by augmenting Step 2 and 3 is indeed a more effcient way to do that. However, if we compute PMFs for each result $Y$, that taking the maximum over all Ys is easer. As in:
#
# If the PMF $P(Y|O)$ is computed, most likely $y$ can be computed by taking $\text{max}(P(Y|O))$. If we don't have the PMF, we can copmute the maximum directly:
#
# $$max(P(Y, O)) =  \big(\prod\limits_{Y_i}^{m} P(Y_i) \big) \max\limits_{X_1^H} \big( \prod P(\text{has $X_1^H, Y_i, O_i$ but not $X_js$}) \big)  \max\limits_{X_2^H} \big( \prod P(\text{has $X_2^H, X_1^H, Y_i, O_i$ but not $X_js$}) \big) max \big(...\big)$$
#
#
#
# **Step 5**: Bucket elimination - simplify 2 and 3 to directly computing results out of observations. At j-th sum, instead sum over the the possible values of j-th hidden variable.
#
#

# + [markdown] id="rXmWJvC2p7GM"
#
#
# In this notebook, we aim to showcase the following features:
#
# * Defining generic Node and Bayes Net classes.
# * Creating and disaplying bayes nets (manually generated and randomly generated).
# * Given the observations, compute and display the posterior distribution for each node (likely through basic enumeration - enumerate node, chain rule to its parents, etc)
# * Given the observations, compute and display the most likely configuration of the entire network (compute last point, take max over each distribution (?)kind of like viterbi over full system).
# * Given observations and a specific query node, compute the most likely state of that node (this should still require computing posterior density functions for each intermediate node, i believe).
#
#
# Everything above has been agnostic to which nodes are considered as observation nodes and query nodes.
# * Let's now define specific nodes as observations and specific nodes as attacks. Perform bucket elimination over the system by marginalizing hidden variables.
# * Use bucket elimination to efficiently compute joint probability distribution over variables of interest only.
# * Show that bucket elimination doesn't work for a large number of nodes.
# * Potential stretch goal: use monte carlo sampling to approximate posterior distributions.
#
# -------------------
#
# As of now, we are still unclear whether we plan to use a specific class to represent the Bayes net (as in the next cell), or use lists of Nodes (as in the subsequent cells). We'll need to decide whether we want methods to be  stand-alone or as part of a class.
